Builder
=======

A very simple automated build template.

1. Ready...

 ```
 git clone git://github.com/pikpik/Builder.git
 ```

2. Set...

 Edit settings.sh, build.sh, and report.sh in scripts.

3. Go!

 ```
 sh start.sh
 ```

 The build system will run and report in the foreground.

To Come
-------

A template script will be added for synchronizing logs and results with a remote server.

Scripts will be improved for templating.
