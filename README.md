Builder
=======

A very simple automated build template.

Instructions
------------

1. ```git clone git://github.com/pikpik/Builder.git```  
  
2. Edit settings.sh, build.sh, and report.sh in scripts.  
  
3. ```sh start.sh```  

The build system will run and report in the foreground.

To Come
-------

A template script will be added for synchronizing logs and results with a remote server.

Scripts will be improved for templating.
